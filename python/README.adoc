= Fixing the Billion Dollar Mistake in Java

== Usage

* Run program `python index.py`
* Run tests `pytest`


=== Install Python via pyenv (Optional but useful)

Install link:https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv[Pyenv] and configure your shell (`~/.bash_profile` or similar) with pyenv documentation.

. Check if you have a current python version installed: `pyenv versions`
** If not, install a current Python version: `pyenv install 3.10.0`
** List other available versions via: `pyenv install --list`
. Check that the local python version is current: `pyenv local`
** If no current version is used, set it: `pyenv local 3.10.0`
. Check that the right python version is used: `python --version`
** If the wrong python version is displayed, then your shell is not configured correctly. I had to follow the fish instructions because that is my main shell.

=== Install Requirements (via Pip)

* Main requirements `pip install -r requirements.txt`
* Test requirements `pip install -r requirements-test.txt`
