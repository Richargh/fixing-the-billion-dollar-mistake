= Fixing the Billion Dollar Mistake in Java

== Usage

* Run program `python index.py`
* Run tests `pytest`


=== Install Python via pyenv (Optional but useful)

Install link:https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv[Pyenv] and configure your shell (`~/.bash_profile` or similar) with pyenv documentation.

. Check if you have a current python version installed: `pyenv versions`
** If not, install a current Python version: `pyenv install 3.10.0`
** List other available versions via: `pyenv install --list`
. Check that the local python version is current: `pyenv local`
** If no current version is used, set it: `pyenv local 3.10.0`
. Check that the right python version is used: `python --version`
** If the wrong python version is displayed, then your shell is not configured correctly. I had to follow the fish instructions because that is my main shell.

=== Install Requirements (via Pip)

* Main requirements `pip install -r requirements.txt`
* Test requirements `pip install -r requirements-test.txt`

== Python

Python has been around for a long time: version 1.0 was released January 1994, compare that with Java 1.0 (January 1996), Javascript (December 1995) and C# 1.0 (January 2002).
Since it's original release it has grown steadily in popularity and since link:https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/[October 2021 the TIOBE index considers it the most popular programming language].
One of the reasons for that is that it's evolved significantly over the years and received numerous interesting new features:

* 3.0 (2000): link:https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3107/[Function Annotations]
* 3.5 (2015): link:https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/[type hints], see also link:https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/cheat_sheet_py3.html[Python Type Hints Cheat Sheet] and link:https://dropbox.tech/application/our-journey-to-type-checking-4-million-lines-of-python[how Dropbox added type hints to 4 million lines of Python]
