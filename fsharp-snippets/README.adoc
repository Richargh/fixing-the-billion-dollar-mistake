== Null in F#

link:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fsharp/language-reference/values/null-values[Null Values]:

> The null value is not normally used in F# for values or variables. [...] If a type is defined in some other .NET language, null is a possible value, and when you are interoperating with such types, your F# code might encounter null values.

> You can use the option type in F# when you might use a reference variable with a possible null value in another .NET language.

> To interpret a null value that is obtained from a .NET method, use pattern matching if you can.

So far F# does not have nullable reference types. The language models optional features with `Option<T>`.

== Other Language Constructs

* Ternary operator: `if .. then .. else`
