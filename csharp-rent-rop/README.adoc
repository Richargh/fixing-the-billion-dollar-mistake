= Classic vs Railway-Oriented Programming (ROP) in C#

== Tech Stack

* C#9 and .NET 5
* Xunit

== Usage

. Run classic console: `dotnet run -p classic`
. Run ROP console: `dotnet run -p rop`
. Run tests: `dotnet test`

== Railway-Oriented Programming examples

Keep in mind that this repo has its own link:Classic/Common/Rop/Result.cs[Result] implementation.
It's not using an existing library.
The code that enables ROP is only three classes big though, so it's easy to get around.

* Check out the link:Test/RegisterEmployeeUseCaseContract.cs[Register Employee UseCase] first, then look at the link:Classic/ClassicRegisterEmployeeUseCase.cs[Classic implementation] and the link:Rop/RopRegisterEmployeeUseCase.cs[ROP implementation].
* After that you are free to check out any of the other use cases or their contracts. :)
