= Fixing the Billion Dollar Mistake

Example code in different languages for handling the billion dollar mistake.

Some languages have code "snippets" folders where I play around with some language features, for example link:csharp-snippets[C# Snippets].
C# in particular also has a folder where I show some link:csharp-rent-rop[Railway-oriented Programming] code to handle employees and them renting notebooks.
A simpler version of this code can be found in the link:java-rent[Java] and link:python-rent[Python] folders.
