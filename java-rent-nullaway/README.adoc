= Fixing the Billion Dollar Mistake in Java with NullAway

== Tech Stack

* link:http://errorprone.info/[ErrorProne]
* link:https://github.com/uber/NullAway[NullAway]
** NullAway assumes that the absence of a `@Nullable` annotation means the type is non-null.
** NullAway respects multiple `@Nullable` annotations, including custom ones.
The name just has to be "Nullable".
* Jackson
** Jackson does not validate fields.
Unfortunately that includes validating @Nullable annotations.
* Hibernate-Validation
** Used to validate `@Nullable` fields and that null fields not annotated throw exceptions.
** We need a custom link:src/main/java/de/richargh/billiondollar/commons/annotations/Nullable.java[`@Nullable`] annotation that has runtime retention and have to add a link:src/main/java/de/richargh/billiondollar/commons/json/external/DefaultIsNonNullableValidator.java[`DefaultIsNonNullableValidator`] so that null-deserialization without `@Nullable` annotation throws an exception.

TODO: jackson respects @Nullable?, does nullaway check compile-time-mapping??, jdbi respects @Nullable?
